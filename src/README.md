## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Glassmorphism & Depth
- Frosted glass effects with backdrop-filter blur
- Layered transparency creating visual depth
- Subtle borders and shadows for definition

### Motion Design
- Hardware-accelerated animations (transform/opacity only)
- Scroll-triggered animations for engagement
- Micro-interactions enhancing user experience
- Reduced motion support for accessibility

### Typography Hierarchy
- Large display fonts for headlines (up to 8rem)
- Readable sans-serif for body text
- Custom font weight and spacing tokens
- Gradient text effects for emphasis

## 🎭 Animation Details

### Morphing Logo Implementation
The logo animation consists of multiple stages:

1. **Initial State**: Individual letter spans in "DripSync"
2. **Trigger Detection**: Scroll position monitoring via Motion's useScroll
3. **Morphing Phase**: Letters animate to predetermined positions forming monkey silhouette
4. **Monkey Reveal**: SVG monkey logo fades in with layered animations:
   - Headphones with sound wave pulses
   - Goggles with shine effects every 5 seconds
   - Eye movements and subtle breathing

### Performance Considerations
- Uses `transform3d` for hardware acceleration
- Implements `will-change` CSS property appropriately
- Debounced scroll listeners to prevent jank
- Reduced motion media query support

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- Mobile: 320px - 768px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px  
- Desktop: 1024px - 1440px
- Large: 1440px+

### Mobile Optimizations
- Touch-friendly interactive elements
- Optimized animation performance
- Compressed image delivery
- Streamlined navigation menu

## ♿ Accessibility Features

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactive elements
- **Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliant color ratios
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects prefers-reduced-motion setting
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order

## 🔧 Customization

### Theme Colors
Update CSS variables in `styles/globals.css`:
```css
:root {
  --drip-neon-teal: #00D4AA;
  --drip-deep-purple: #6B46C1;
  --drip-warm-yellow: #F59E0B;
  /* ... */
}
```

### Animation Timing
Modify animation durations in component files:
```typescript
// Adjust morphing animation speed
transition={{ duration: 0.8, delay: index * 0.1 }}
```

### Content Management
- Event data: `data/events.ts`
- Team information: `data/team.ts`
- Service details: `components/pages/ServicesPage.tsx`
